To use this.

1. fill the /org directory with .org files
2. launch ./build.sh script to generate the .html files in /html directory
   (make sure it has execution permissions =chmod +x build.sh=)

Did not want to clutter the original emacs config, that is why I did not put
the =build-site.el= contents in the original emacs config. This is also easier
to maintain I think, you always know how to build your website no matter where
you are.

To publish the changes - push to git, make sure github pages option is enabled
in the repo.

Navigate to [[arvydasg.github.io/org-static-blog/html/index.html][arvydasg.github.io/org-static-blog/html/index.html]] and you shoul
see this blog. You can open this blog locally also, but all the links will lead
to to [[/org-static-blog/html/index.html][arvydasg.github.io]].

If we put html files inside the same location as README.org file, then we would
not have the =/html/= part in the url, which is nicer. But from the backend,
having a html folder is nicer and cleaner.

Lots of shortcuts already in my head, but some that are new are:

- win + ctrl + t - always on top window
- alt + space - look for programs
- win + shift + / - ALL SHORTCUTS
- win+shift+T - TEXT EXTRACTOR WTF??!!

Install =powertoys= app in windows for rebinding various keys, especially caps
-> ctrl
